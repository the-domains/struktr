  This is 10 steps away from where Göztepe Subway Station, Exit 4, on the left
  hand-side. Every day, thousands of people walk this path to reach where
  they're headed to. This is a very public space. Behind the fences (it may also
  be, we are behind the fences) there's a land, disturbed by infrastructural
  waste, the residual edge of a mega construction. As gazing gets longer and
  deeper, it pings back to self like a laser; bladed with alienation and civil
  embarrassment, where one (or public) is situated lower than the trash layer of
  this particular hood in the city. Further in the scene, two towers are rising,
  supporting and reinforcing each other. A resident might have been fallen here,
  and scan around to see a familiar visible item, or unluckily, the owner these
  towers might pass through this stage; and for both, it's one of the many
  conditions to gain an awareness of+in the circumstance, in someone else's
  shoes. In middle layer, the sites are laid like a rampart, seem like a shield
  for towers (from this point of view). Populated in more or less white and
  alike, they holding on safe and secure, by not allowing any kind of outer (or
  worst case, inner) intervention. For anyone among those people (we can be one
  of them), it might be a regular point to stare the conditioning from afar, or
  just think why the dwelling cannot be reached in 3 min. with a breathable
  shortcut, rather than a 20 minutes heavy toxic jogging to circle the borders
  of a mega inhumane construction which has no communication with humans except
  than a plate, written; "This property is protected by Security Cameras"
  Heading back to destination, the triggered feeling of gratitude, a conditioned
  inner force and a portal to 10G might extract a veil to conceal or crack the
  harsh concrete reality. In addition, inhaling higher doses of automative
  exhaustion can cause blurry activity, over acceptance of destiny, praying for
  towers or cars and deep physical, mental, spiritual suffering.
